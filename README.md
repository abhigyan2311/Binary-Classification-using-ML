# Binary Classification using Machine Learning

A company attrition dataset was used for this problem to classify the status of employees.

The following machine learning techniques were used to perform binary classification on the given dataset:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Decission Tree Classifier
6. Random Forest Classifier
7. Artificial Neural Networks
8. Gradient Boosting Machines - XGBoost

This notebook covers all the practical application part from **Feature Engineering**, **Data Visualization**, **Modelling** to **Metric Computation** in a very simple manner so that its easy to understand.
